# Implementing

Typically, you should never have to implement this trait yourself. Implementation is handled automatically through the [model](crate::prelude::model) attribute macro. Behind the scenes, this macro rebuilds your struct to support the musty model system. For more information, read the [`model` macro documentation](crate::prelude::model).
